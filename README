I was initially thinking about what you were saying about creating a toy, and how what we submitted for this project does not necessarily have to be a fully fleshed out idea for a game. The goal with this was to use several of ths skills from the previous projects, such as collection, physics layers, triggers, and click and drag to make something that feels like it could be a game in the future. 
In this game, you drag cubes into the right color order to collect falling cubes. There are slots along the bottom that shows you where the falling cubes will be collected. If you miss a cube, it resets to the begining, if you collect all the cubes it adds one (up to 4). At this point, it just this very simple loop, but if I were to continue with this project, or one like it, I would plan on adding additional mechanic, like have to rotate cubes as well as drag them to collect objects, and flesh out the progression between stages. If I were to continue, I also imagine this as a phone game, where the cubes are dragged with your fingers rather than using your mouse.
